# simWheelChaos
A modular, from-scratch sim racing project focused on learning raw sensor input, controller emulation, and custom hardware—from phone IMUs to a full DIY racing setup.
---

## Goals
- Learn how raw motion and input data works
- Build a controller
- Create a DIY sim racing setup
- Prioritize learning, experimentation, and iteration\

---

## Project Philosophy
- Break everything into the smallest possible testable units
- One change at a time, always test before moving on
- No black boxes — understand every layer
- Mistakes are part of the design process

---

## Planned Roadmap

Phase 0 — Understand accepted input standards (HID, XInput, DirectInput)

Phase 1 — Phone as gyroscope and accelerometer data

Phase 2 — Phone → PC Communication & Virtual Controller Emulation

Phase 4 — Identify Latency and Test on Games

Phase 5 — Control Theory

Phase 6 — Hardware Upgrades

## Tools & Tech (planned)
- Android phone (IMU sensors)
- PC (Windows)
- Microcontrollers
- USB HID / Virtual Joystick drivers
- Custom firmware and control software

---

## Status
🚧 Early planning & experimentation
